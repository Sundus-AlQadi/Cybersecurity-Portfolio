# Day 04 Progress - Authentication Vulnerabilities

## Completed Labs
- Authentication Lab 02: Username enumeration via subtly different responses
- Authentication Lab 03: Username enumeration via response timing

## Topics Covered
- Username enumeration
- Subtle response differences
- Grep - Extract in Burp Intruder
- Response timing analysis
- Password brute-force using provided wordlists
- Burp Intruder Pitchfork attack
- X-Forwarded-For header
- IP-based brute-force protection bypass in a controlled lab environment
- Identifying successful login attempts using `302` responses

## Tools Used
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy
- Burp Suite Community Edition
- Burp Proxy
- Burp Intruder
- GitHub

## Reflection
Today I continued the Authentication vulnerabilities section in PortSwigger Web Security Academy.

I practiced two username enumeration techniques. The first relied on subtle differences in error messages, while the second relied on response timing differences. I learned that authentication systems can leak valid usernames even when they appear to use generic error messages.

I also practiced using Burp Intruder more effectively, including Grep - Extract, Pitchfork attacks, response timing columns, and payload positions for headers and parameters.

## Current Progress
- Completed SQL Injection basics and UNION-based labs
- Completed SQL Injection database enumeration basics
- Started Authentication vulnerabilities
- Completed username enumeration labs based on different responses, subtle response differences, and response timing

## Next Step
Continue Authentication vulnerabilities, focusing on brute-force protection flaws and password reset vulnerabilities.
